### Project Overview
This project was created as part of a task assignment from RYZE Digital company. It is a simple, fully functional React application that demonstrates basic user authentication, protected routing, and CRUD-like behavior using local state and localStorage.

## Programming languages/technologies: React, TypeScript

Once logged in with the correct credentials, users are redirected to a detail page where they can add, update, and view entries that consist of a title and date. The entries are managed in-memory and provide a basic demonstration of component-driven form handling, conditional rendering, and state management using React Hooks. Unauthorized users attempting to access protected routes are redirected to the login page.

The application showcases:

A login system using hardcoded credentials and localStorage for session simulation.

A protected route mechanism that restricts access to certain pages unless the user is authenticated.

A form-driven UI that allows users to add or edit entries, with real-time validation and input management.

Clean navigation between login and detail views using React Router.
